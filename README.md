# Leaflet-Challenge

In this challenge, the U.S. Geological Survey is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualize their earthquake data. 

They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. 

In this challenge, their hope is to be able to visualize their data which will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding...) on issues facing our planet.
